# `wordcount.vim`

This is a tiny plugin that adds a word count operator. Basically, it just pipes the selected text
through to `wc -w`.

# Warning!

You probably shouldn't use this plugin. I only spent about 5 minutes writing it because I was doing
a lot of word counts one day. It probably has a bunch of bugs, and it depends on
(`tap.vim`)[https://github.com/simonhicks/tap.vim] which you probably don't have installed, and it
makes the obnoxious assumption that you want the same keybinding that I do.
